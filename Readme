Aldrich, Suzanne	aigeanta@cs.stanford.eduComment: I really like Constructor!Essay:1) Yes, the call chain is different for the CXPane in the LScroller than in the window because there are two LViews, the LScroller and the LView, between the window and thenested CXPane.2) The origin appears to be in the top left corner of the window they're in.3) The origin appears to be in the top left corner of the scrollable region it's in.4) I don't understand this question; too many typos. However, I think you're asking me what message is sent to LPane to change it's position. The relative method is MoveBy.5) The relative method to change size is ResizeFrameBy.6) It would *not* be ok to change the inherited state directly because it violates the internal consistency principle.The End.
